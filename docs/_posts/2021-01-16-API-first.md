[API first](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#api-first) is a very interesting concept. With the help of `connexion[swagger-ui]`, a flask based server code can be easily generated from the openapi file. It is convenience, and easy to use, but with a little uncertain also kind of less flexibility. That is the trade-off. 

ps. following is temprature and humidity detector with arduino, it took me a lot of time to adjust the characters on the old fashion Nokia5110 screen, but it was fun to explore the details.

![Here is how the detector looks like](https://github.com/ao-song/ao-song.github.io/blob/gh-pages/docs/_posts/img/arduino_hum_tmp.png?raw=true)
